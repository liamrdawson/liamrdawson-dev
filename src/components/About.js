                    <p className="about-text">
                        I also do freelance web design for projects which I find interesting, challenging or exciting and am often busy working on my own own side projects to develop my own skillset or to simply solve problems.

                    <p className="about-text">
                        I primarily work in React and have experience using Webpack, ES6, Babel and Node, among other technologies. Iâ€™m a self starter, enjoy working in teams and love jumping into the latest and greatest technologies.

                    <p className="about-text">
                        I also enjoy <a href="https://liamrdawson.com">street photography</a>, and you can sometimes find me wandering around Brighton with my camera looking for a nice shot to take.
